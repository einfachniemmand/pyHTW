# pyHTW
A command-line version of HTW (Hack The Web).
Hack The Web is an online puzzle game about computer science, cryptography and web developement developed by [@Erkenntnis](https://github.com/Entkenntnis).

My command-line based version has almost all features of the website. To install it on windows, use the install.bat file or install it manually. On other OSs, install python along all other imports manually and then run htw.py.
