# pyHTW
A command-line version of HTW (Hack The Web).
Hack The Web is an online puzzle game about computer science, cryptography and web developement developed by [@Erkenntnis](https://github.com/Entkenntnis). See its website [here](https://hack.arrrg.de/)
<br>
My command-line based version has almost all features of the website. To install it on windows, use the [install.bat](https://github.com/einfachniemmand/pyHTW/blob/main/install.bat) file (no need to download [htw.py](https://github.com/einfachniemmand/pyHTW/blob/main/htw.py) here!) or install it manually like on other OSs. On other OSs, install python along all other imports manually and then run [htw.py](https://github.com/einfachniemmand/pyHTW/blob/main/htw.py).
